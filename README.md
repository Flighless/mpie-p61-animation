# Practical 6.1: Animation in Maya

In the first lecture this week we learned about some key principles of animation in 3D environments, and how we can work with them in Maya. In this practical, you’re going to put that learning into action and do some of the things that were shown in the lecture. 

By the end of this practical, you’ll be able to bring objects and even characters to life – making scenes that are dynamic and realistic. In particular you’ll be able to:

- Create an animated piece of scenery
- Rig your first character
- Combine all of these skills to create an animated character!

In this practical, you’ll be using Maya. This is already installed for you on our lab machines. However, if you’d like to continue to work with it on your personal machine, you can get a free educational license here:
